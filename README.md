Recently: Worked on Secure Extensions for Image-Based Linux with the Flatcar team. [Flatcar Linux](https://www.flatcar.org/) is a project out of Kinvolk (now [acquired by Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-acquires-kinvolk-to-accelerate-containeroptimized-innovation/)). Mentored by Thilo Fromm from Microsoft Germany. Along with my internship, I'm also contributing bug fixes and solving backlog in open source projects in my spare time.

Testimonials: 

"Throughout the internship, Krish remained highly motivated, displayed a strong eagerness to learn, and always delivered towards his goals. He contributed significant improvements to the Flatcar project and helped create a solid foundation for our composable images initiative." - Thilo Fromm, Microsoft Germany (Summer 2023)

"Krish was able to get up to speed in an unfamiliar environment quickly and made some really impactful contributions. He was able to not only work on his core project (system extension images), but also took the time to submit bug fixes and updates to various components of Flatcar. He displays a lot of curiosity, willingness to learn and a drive to solve user problems. These are the qualities we are looking for at Microsoft. I am convinced he will be successful in his studies and wish him the best on his path to becoming a software engineer." - Jeremy Piotrowski, Microsoft Germany (Summer 2023)
