Hi, I'm Krish. As an undergraduate student and software engineer, I am constantly seeking new opportunities to learn and grow in the tech industry, with a particular interest in deep tech startups. I have a strong passion for innovative products and am determined to build a value-driven future that benefits everyone.

As an aspiring researcher, scientist, and engineer, I have a range of interests ranging from natural language processing, back-end development, deep learning to chaos engineering and cloud computing with specific interest in virtualization technologies. I am also interested in exploring the use of quantitative and computational methods in the humanities and social sciences. Over the last couple of years, I have conducted research in diverse fields including cyber security, biotechnology, and natural disasters over the last few years.

Resourceful, passionate, and resilient are three words that best describe me.
